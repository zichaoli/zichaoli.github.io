I'm a Master student of ECE at UCSD. I obtained my B.S. from Nanjing University in 2019. My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning. I am particularly interested in adversarial machine learning.

<!-- ## Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in Data Mining Problems and Applications:
- Text Mining, Information Extraction, and Natural Language Processing
- Structured Mining in Large-Scale Text-Rich Networks
- Understanding and Improving Deep Neural Networks
- Interdisciplinary Applications (e.g., Biomedical, IoT, ...)

Most of my research projects focus on (1) developing principled data-driven approaches with light human effort and (2) building effective and robust machine learning models in an efficient way. -->
