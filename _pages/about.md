I'm a Master student of CSE at UCSC. I obtained my B.S. from Nanjing University in 2019 and my M.S. from UCSD advised by Prof. [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io01/). I'm actively in the job market now.

## Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in deep learing:
- Generative AI
- AI for Science (e.g. AI for material science)
- Multimodal learning
- AI Safty, including model robustness and attack
